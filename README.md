# SVG-Use

Make easy use of SVG symbols within the project

## Features

Place the widget on the page and set the SVG Symbol name to one of the possible symbols inside the project.

Which icon names are available? Check this file in your project folder: theme/web/images/svg-symbols-demo-page.html

If there is no such file present, there are no symbols available. A front-end developer can provide the project with SVG
symbols.

Add a SVG size to display the icon on.

Configure the SVG color. This can also be a `CSS variable` or `"currentColor"`.

Set a onClick action if anything should happen on click.
